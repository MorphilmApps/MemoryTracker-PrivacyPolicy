        <h1>Privacy Policy for MemoryTracker</h1>

        <div class="dates">
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 23rd, 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 23rd, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <h2>TL;DR - Privacy Summary</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Your memory card and storage data never leaves your device (unless you enable iCloud sync).</strong> We don't run servers, create accounts, or sell data.</p>

            <p><strong>Free version with ads:</strong> Google AdMob (not us) collects device identifiers, usage data, and approximate location for ad delivery. This data is not linked to your personal identity. You control tracking through iOS settings.</p>

            <p><strong>After purchasing "Premium" (lifetime, monthly, or annual):</strong> No more data collection from advertising networks. Your app becomes completely private - all memory card data stays on your device and your optional iCloud backup.</p>

            <p><strong>iCloud sync (optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud sync in settings, your SD card data, storage locations, and backup logs are encrypted and synced to your personal iCloud account via CloudKit. You can disable this anytime.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Morphilm Apps ("we," "our," or "us") operates the MemoryTracker mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use our App.</p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. MemoryTracker is designed to keep your memory card and storage data private and secure on your device unless you explicitly give permission.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        </ul>

        <div class="important">

        </div>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically (Only in Free Version with Ads)</h3>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The data described below is collected by <strong>Google AdMob</strong> (not by us, Morphilm Apps) and <strong>only when ads are displayed</strong>. Once you purchase "Premium" (lifetime, monthly, or annual), this data collection stops completely.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Google AdMob (Third-Party Advertising Service)</h4>
        <p>To support our small family business and keep the app free, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the free version. <strong>Google</strong> (not Morphilm Apps) may collect and process the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers (such as Advertising ID/IDFA)</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: How you interact with ads, ad impressions, clicks</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Approximate location based on IP address (not precise GPS location)</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity</strong>: Which features you use and when</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver relevant advertisements</li>
            <li>Measure ad performance</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent fraud</li>
            <li>Improve ad services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We May Collect Through Feedback</h3>
        <p>When you voluntarily submit feedback through our in-app feedback form, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Information</strong>: Your email address (only if you choose to provide it)</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Content</strong>: The subject and message you submit</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: iOS version, device model, and app version (automatically included to help with technical support)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feedback submissions are processed through <strong>Formspree</strong>, a third-party form handling service. We use this information only to respond to your inquiries and improve our app. Your email address (if provided) is used solely for responding to your feedback.</p>

        <h2>Tracking and Personalized Advertising</h2>

        <h3>App Tracking Transparency</h3>
        <p>MemoryTracker requests your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for personalized advertising. This is done through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
        <p>When you first launch the App, you will see a system prompt asking:</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Allow MemoryTracker to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites?"
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google AdMob can use your Advertising ID (IDFA) to show you personalized ads based on your interests</li>
            <li>Ad performance may be better targeted to your preferences</li>
            <li>You may see more relevant advertisements</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you decline tracking:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You will still see advertisements, but they will be contextual (non-personalized)</li>
            <li>Your Advertising ID will not be used for cross-app tracking</li>
            <li>Ad frequency and content will not be customized based on your behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Changing Your Tracking Preferences</h3>
        <p>You can change your tracking preference at any time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone/iPad</li>
            <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>MemoryTracker</strong></li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>Allow Tracking</strong> on or off</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Alternatively, you can manage tracking for all apps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Privacy & Security</strong></li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Tracking</strong></li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>Allow Apps to Request to Track</strong> on or off</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Removing Ads = Complete Privacy</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Want complete privacy? Purchase "Premium" with flexible options.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>You can purchase the <strong>Ad-Free</strong> upgrade within the App to completely remove all advertisements. We offer flexible purchase options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifetime Purchase</strong>: One-time payment for permanent ad removal</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Subscription</strong>: Recurring monthly payment for ad removal</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Subscription</strong>: Recurring annual payment for ad removal (best value)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you purchase any ad removal option:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All ads are removed</strong> from your experience</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob stops collecting data</strong> (since ads are no longer displayed)</li>
            <li><strong>Zero tracking</strong> - No device identifiers, no usage data, no location data collected</li>
            <li><strong>100% private</strong> - All your memory card data stays exclusively on your device and your optional iCloud backup</li>
            <li>Your purchase is managed securely through Apple's App Store</li>
            <li>The upgrade is linked to your Apple ID and persists across reinstalls</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>After purchasing ad removal, the only data stored is:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your SD card and storage device data (stored locally on your device)</li>
            <li>Your app preferences (stored locally on your device)</li>
            <li>Your purchase receipt (managed securely by Apple, not accessible to us)</li>
            <li>Optional iCloud backup (encrypted and controlled by you)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>iCloud sync is completely optional and controlled by you.</strong> You can enable or disable it anytime in the app's Settings.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What is iCloud Sync?</h3>
        <p>MemoryTracker offers optional iCloud synchronization using Apple's CloudKit technology. When enabled, your data is synced across all your Apple devices signed into the same iCloud account.</p>

        <h3>What Data is Synced?</h3>
        <p>When you enable iCloud sync, the following data is synced to your personal iCloud account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SD Card Information</strong>: All card details, specifications, and metadata</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Device Information</strong>: All storage location details and specifications</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Logs</strong>: History of backup operations between cards and storage devices</li>
            <li><strong>Photos</strong>: Optional photos you've added to cards or storage devices (synced via CloudKit assets)</li>
            <li><strong>Project Organization</strong>: Project names, colors, and dates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How iCloud Sync Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is encrypted by Apple's CloudKit</li>
            <li>Only accessible by you through your Apple ID</li>
            <li>Automatically syncs across your iPhone, iPad, and other iOS devices</li>
            <li>Changes made on one device appear on all your devices</li>
            <li>Subject to Apple's privacy policy and iCloud terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enabling/Disabling iCloud Sync</h3>
        <p>You can control iCloud sync at any time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open MemoryTracker</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> on or off</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disabling iCloud sync does not delete your data from your device</li>
            <li>Your data remains on your device even with iCloud sync disabled</li>
            <li>iCloud sync uses your iCloud storage quota</li>
            <li>We (Morphilm Apps) cannot access your iCloud data</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The memory card and storage data you enter is stored only on your device (and optionally in your iCloud account). We recommend that parents supervise their children's use of the App if they have concerns about data entry.

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>Morphilm Apps does not collect, sell, trade, or transfer your personal information.</strong></p>

        <p>Data may be shared with third parties only in these specific circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (free version only): Google collects advertising data as described above. We do not have access to this data.</li>
            <li><strong>Formspree</strong> (when you submit feedback): Only if you voluntarily choose to send us feedback through the in-app form</li>
            <li><strong>Apple</strong> (in-app purchases): Your purchase is managed by Apple's secure payment system. We only know if you purchased ad removal, not your payment details.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple</strong> (iCloud sync): If you enable iCloud sync, your data is synced to your personal iCloud account managed by Apple.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong>: If required by law or to protect our rights</li>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Once you purchase "Premium":</strong> Google AdMob no longer collects or shares any data about you since ads are not displayed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. While we use Google AdMob for advertising, this does not constitute a "sale" under most privacy laws. However, you can control personalized advertising through your device's tracking settings as described above.</p>

        <h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>Currently, MemoryTracker does not use dedicated analytics or crash reporting services beyond what is provided by Google AdMob for ad performance in the free version.</p>
        <p>If we add analytics services in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify users through an App update.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

            <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>Notify you through an in-app message or update notes</li>
            <li>For significant changes, request your renewed consent where required by law</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
